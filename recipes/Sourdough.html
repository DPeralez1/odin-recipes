    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This San Francisco sourdough recipe makes two loaves. Use a good sourdough
      starter, one you have tended to, for the best flavor.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="Ingredients">
      <li>4 ¾ cups bread flour, or more as needed</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>2 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>1 cup warm milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons margarine, softened</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups sourdough starter</li>
      <li>1 extra large egg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Add warm
        milk and margarine. Stir in starter. Mix in remaining 3 3/4 cups flour
        gradually; you may need to add more flour depending on the climate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead for 8 to 10 minutes.
        Place dough into a greased bowl, turn once to oil surface, and cover.
        Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Punch down dough; cover and let rest for 15 minutes. Divide dough in
        half and shape into 2 loaves. Place loaves on a greased baking pan.
        Allow to rise until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
      <li>
        Stir together egg and water in a small bowl until well combined. Brush
        over the tops of loaves, then sprinkle with onion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until loaves are golden brown and cooked
        through, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the
        center of a loaf should read 190 degrees F (88 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
